## 💾 Usage

## ⚠️  Caveats:
- ***Currently not feature complete!***
- Requires bunarr and json-c
- Walls w and h are relative to the minimum wall size, 
this means you must multiply the w and h by the tile size of your game before using them.

## 🗒️ Todo:
- Add proper support for different tile sizes and stuff
- Add Examples
- Add Super Simple Export Support
- Add PNG Level Export Support
- Add PNG Layer Export Support
- Proper error handling
- Generate docs with doxygen???
